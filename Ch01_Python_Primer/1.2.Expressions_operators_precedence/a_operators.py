'''
6. Sequence Operators
Each of Python's built-in sequence types (str, tuple, and list) support the following operator syntaxes:

s[j]	element at index j
s[start:stop]	slice including indices [start,stop)
s[start:stop:step]	slice including indices start, start + step, start + 2 * step, . . ., up to but not equalling or stop
s + t	concatenation of sequences
k * s	shorthand for s + s + s + . . . (k times)
val in s	containment check
val not in s	non-containment check
